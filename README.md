about me !
Hi, Iâ€™m Muhammad Yasir! Iâ€™m passionate about learning Data Science, Data Analysis, and Machine Learning. ðŸš€ This is my first project, where I analyze the Titanic dataset and apply ML models to predict passenger survival. If you find any mistakes or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to share. Thanks! ðŸ˜Š
